This repo will contain the source of my free (and open-source) admin suit for Spigot.

Here is a list of features I want to add:

* Player reporting
* Managing bans with custom ban messages etc.
* The ability to go into a "spectator" mode which completely vanishes you and adds some useful stuff into your inventory.
* Much more stuff I can't think of right now.
